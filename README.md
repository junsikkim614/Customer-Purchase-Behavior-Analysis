# Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes customer purchasing patterns to classify and predict what products they are likely to buy based on demographic and behavioral factors. The dataset includes customer attributes such as age, gender, purchase history, and payment method, among others.

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, Data Cleaning, Classification, Regression, Clustering, Association Rule Mining

**Key findings** : 
- Males are more likely to purchase clothing when discounts are applied, while females show less preference for discounts.
- Decision Tree Classification outperformed other classification methods in predicting clothing purchases using age, purchase amount, and review ratings.
- Decision Tree Regression was the most suitable regression model for predicting purchase categories based on demographic and purchasing attributes.
- K-means clustering revealed that customers' previous purchase amounts are related to their future purchases, suggesting that targeted marketing based on purchase history could be effective
